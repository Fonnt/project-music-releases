# Music Releases

Practice React and creating components by using data from Spotify and creating a Music-release App.

## The problem

 1. We had problems to add comma between the artists names and we managed to solve it by creating an if statement in one of the components comparing the length of the array and adding the comma sign depending on that.
 2. Using flexbox by combining space between caused an uneven space between the cards. Solved it using column-gap with justify-content= space-between.
  
3. If we had more time we could style it even more with hovering the heart icone and adding strech goals to the project.
